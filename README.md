# Doze-Mode
if a user leaves a device unplugged & stationary for a period of time

# Testing Doze Mode

Make sure your device is connected with usb.
Go to android studio open any android demo project ( or create new if you don't have one ).

To exit the doze mode, run the following command :

**adb shell dumpsys deviceidle unforce**

Use below command to reactivate the device by performing the following command ( i.e. usb will again start behaving as charging point for your mobile)
